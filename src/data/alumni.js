Before joining the program, the process of getting an internship seemed very complicated and confusing: I didn’t know where to start and what to do. But under the supervision of mentors, it became straightforward. Following the plan constructed for me by my mentor, I didn't even notice how I got my dream offer. I really felt that our mentors cared about us and did their best to support us.",
